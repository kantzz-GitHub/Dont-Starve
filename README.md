# TasteCraft-iOS

"TasteCraft" is an iOS application that helps people with little to 
no experience in cooking to search, follow recipes in a 
straightforward "idiot-proof" manner.
Users can rely on a wide selection of recipes, save their favourite ones 
or create one of their own.
"TasteCraft"'s mission is to help people gain independence 
and to instill them the love for cooking.
