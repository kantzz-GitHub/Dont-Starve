# Dont-Starve

"Don't Starve!" is an iOS application that helps people with little to 
no experience in cooking to search, follow recipes in a 
straightforward "idiot-proof" manner.
Users can rely on a wide selection of recipes, save their favourite ones 
or create one of their own.
"Don't Starve!"'s mission is to help people gain independence 
and to instill them the love for cooking.
